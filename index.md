This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was the modifications to the code. My modules displayed the weather, calander, time, and date. To that I added a spotify module to display the song I was currently listening to, and a remote that I could control the mirror with from my phone. With the spotify module it took me a while to get it to work because I was doing the steps wrong the first few times. With the mirror module I was able to get it done

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up the Raspberry Pi so that the modules would display on the monitor. To start, I set up and hooked the Raspberry Pi to the right components on the monitor. Then I began installing the software and later was able to change the modules on display. The modules are the information that are displayed on the monitor such as the calander, time, date, weather, and news headlines that updated every 13 minutes. For the first few days, I struggled with code when we were trying to get the python imaging to work, and I later realized it was because it didn't exist. I enjoyed trying different modules to display things that I wanted, but I was not able to display the weather module for a while becuase the api key I was using was wrong.

# Starter Project
For my starter project I did a binary blaster. For this project I had to soulder parts together to create the game. On the first day I learned how to soulder so that I could start attaching parts to the board, and I finished the project on the second day. One problem that I had was after I finished souldering the parts together and putting the batteries in and the game didn't turn on. I later realized that it was because the batteries were not touching the battery clips. From this project I learned how to soulder, what each of the parts do, and how they are important to making the binary blaster game.
