# Smart Mirror
My project is a smart mirror that can display the weather, time, date, calander, and the song I am listening to using Javascript modules. I also added a remote to control the mirror from my phone.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone was building the frame for the mirror so that I could put my project together. To start I had to figure out the dimentions of wood that I needed to cut. First I thought about wha

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was the modifications to the code. My modules displayed the weather, calander, time, and date. To that I added a spotify module to display the song I am currently listening to, and a remote that I could control the mirror with from my phone. The remote can turn the mirror on and off, turn the brightness up and down, and can display certain modules that I choose. With the spotify module it took me a while to get it to work because I was doing the steps wrong the first few times. To create the spotify module I needed to create an app on spotify developers so that I could generate the client ID and secret ID to connect my spotify account to the mirror. The client ID is unique to my app and the seceret ID is used to authorize my web API, which enables the development of HTTP services to other devices, in this case its my mirror.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up the Raspberry Pi so that the modules would display on the monitor. To start, I set up and hooked the Raspberry Pi to the right components on the monitor. Then I began installing the software and later was able to change the modules on display. The modules are the information that are displayed on the monitor such as the calander, time, date, weather, and news headlines that updated every 13 minutes. For the first few days, I struggled with code when we were trying to get the python imaging to work, and I later realized it was because it didn't exist. I enjoyed trying different modules to display things that I wanted, but I was not able to display the weather module for a while becuase the api key I was using was wrong.

# Starter Project
For my starter project I did a binary blaster. For this project I had to soulder parts together to create the game. On the first day I learned how to soulder so that I could start attaching parts to the board, and I finished the project on the second day. The first thing that I struggled with was making sure that I was only souldering the parts that I needed to soulder so that I wouldn't burn the board. Another issue that I ran into was after I completed souldering the parts together and the game wouldn't turn on. I later realized that it was because the batteries were not touching the battery clips, so I readjusted clips to make it fit better. From this project I learned how to soulder, what each of the parts do, and how they are important to making the binary blaster game.
